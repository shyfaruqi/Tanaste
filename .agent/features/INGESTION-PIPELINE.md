# Feature: Ingestion Pipeline (Watch Folder → Library)

## User Experience

The user drops a file (book, movie, audiobook, comic) into a designated "Watch Folder" on their computer. From that moment, everything is automatic:

1. **Detection** — The system notices the file within seconds.
2. **Waiting** — It pauses briefly to make sure the file is fully copied (not half-written).
3. **Fingerprinting** — It creates a unique barcode (SHA-256 hash) that permanently identifies this file, even if it's renamed or moved later.
4. **Scanning** — The appropriate reader (EPUB, video, comic, or generic) opens the file and extracts all embedded information: title, author, year, cover art, series, etc.
5. **Scoring** — The Weighted Voter evaluates all extracted data and determines the most trustworthy value for each field.
6. **Hub assignment** — The system decides which Hub (story group) this file belongs to, or creates a new one.
7. **Organising** — If scoring confidence is high enough (≥85%) or the user has locked any metadata value, the file is moved to a clean, human-readable folder structure in the Library.
8. **Sidecar writing** — A companion `tanaste.xml` file is written alongside the organised file, preserving all metadata in a human-readable format.
9. **Cover art** — The cover image is extracted and saved as `cover.jpg` next to the file.
10. **Background enrichment** — External sources (Apple Books, Audnexus, Wikidata) are quietly queried for better metadata. Results pop in moments later.
11. **Person enrichment** — Authors and narrators are identified, linked, and enriched with portraits from Wikidata.

All of this happens without the user lifting a finger after the initial folder setup.

## Business Rules

| # | Rule | Where enforced |
|---|------|----------------|
| IPR-01 | Files below 85% confidence with no user-locked values stay in the Watch Folder — they are not auto-organised. | IngestionEngine (confidence gate) |
| IPR-02 | Duplicate files (same SHA-256 hash) are silently skipped — no duplicate entries in the library. | MediaAssetRepository (INSERT OR IGNORE + UNIQUE constraint) |
| IPR-03 | Corrupt files are quarantined and flagged — they never enter the organised library. | IngestionEngine (ProcessorResult.IsCorrupt check) |
| IPR-04 | File moves use collision-safe renaming — existing files are never overwritten. Suffixes ` (2)`, ` (3)`, etc. are appended. | FileOrganizer (collision handling) |
| IPR-05 | File moves retry with exponential backoff on I/O errors (up to 5 attempts). | FileOrganizer (retry logic) |
| IPR-06 | Cover art is never stored in the database — it lives as `cover.jpg` on disk next to the file. | IngestionEngine (filesystem-first rule) |
| IPR-07 | The tanaste.xml sidecar is the portable source of truth — if the database is wiped, the library can be rebuilt from XML. | SidecarWriter + LibraryScanner (Great Inhale) |
| IPR-08 | External metadata enrichment is never in the critical path — a failed network call returns empty results. The file remains in the library with its local metadata. | MetadataHarvestingService (non-blocking queue) |
| IPR-09 | The Watch Folder is monitored in real time — new files are detected within seconds. | FileWatcher (FileSystemWatcher with 64KB buffer) |
| IPR-10 | Rapid-fire OS events for the same file are coalesced — only the final state is processed. | DebounceQueue (2-second settle delay) |
| IPR-11 | Failed file-lock probes (file still in use after ~127 seconds) emit a failed candidate for logging, not a silent drop. | DebounceQueue (IsFailed flag) |
| IPR-12 | On startup, existing files in the Watch Folder are scanned — the system reconciles its state without missing anything. | IngestionEngine (startup differential scan) |

## Platform Health

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| File detection (FileWatcher) | **PASS** | Correct, with 64KB buffer to reduce missed events. |
| Debounce & settle (DebounceQueue) | **PASS** | Sophisticated concurrency model with proper cancellation. |
| Hashing (AssetHasher) | **PASS** | Performant, zero-allocation streaming SHA-256. |
| Media processing (Processors) | **PASS** | EPUB, Video, Comic, and Generic processors all working. |
| Scoring integration | **PASS** | Per-field scoring with conflict detection. |
| Auto-organisation | **PASS** | Confidence gate, template-based paths, collision-safe moves. |
| Sidecar writing | **PASS** | Both Hub and Edition XML schemas functional. |
| Great Inhale (LibraryScanner) | **WARN** | Cannot restore the full Hub→Work→Edition→Asset chain after a complete database wipe. Only Hub records and existing-asset editions are restored. |
| Background enrichment | **PASS** | Non-blocking queue with 3-way concurrency. |
| Person enrichment | **WARN** | Working, but the `PersonEnriched` SignalR event has an empty person name (known bug — passes `Guid.Empty` to asset lookup). |
| Deleted file handling | **FAIL** | Only logs the deletion. Does NOT mark the asset as orphaned or update the database. No reconciler exists. |
| Watcher health monitoring | **FAIL** | Non-overflow FileSystemWatcher errors (e.g., network share disconnect) are swallowed. No recovery or notification mechanism. |
| Standalone worker host | **FAIL** | Missing 6+ dependency registrations from Phase 9. Cannot start independently. Only the API host works. |

## PO Summary

The ingestion pipeline is fully operational from file detection through organisation and enrichment. Files land in the Watch Folder, get fingerprinted, scored, organised, and enriched — all automatically. **Three gaps matter: (1) deleted files are logged but never cleaned up in the database, (2) if the filesystem watcher loses its connection (e.g., network drive goes offline), there's no recovery mechanism, and (3) the standalone worker mode is broken due to missing dependencies — only the full Engine works.**
